# üü° Pacman

This project is a basic implementation of the classic arcade game **Pacman**, developed using pure JavaScript with an object-oriented approach and the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern. It was created as part of my **first academic programming project** to practice JavaScript fundamentals and design patterns.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: This project was built early in my learning journey. It is a simple version aimed at practicing core concepts and does **not reflect my current skill level**.
